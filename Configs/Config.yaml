# Color Palettes
# named sets of colors
# text/background are default for all color fields except the LED field
# Other fields except for the LED fields are self-explanatory
# The LED fields are a bar at the top/bottom? of the preset, and must be explicitly specified

# My schema:
# General is used for miscellaneous stuff, right now a bank for enabling/disabling pedals
#   General Dark is used for "Bank Jump" presets to a general bank
# Experimental is used for noodling, exploring pedal configs, anything that is for experimenting/creating
#   ExperimentalDark is used for "Bank Jump" presets to an experimental bank
# Songs is used for songs/pieces of music
#   SongsDark is used for "Bank Jump" presets to a bank of songs or a bank for a song
# Navigation is used for navigation banks/presets

  # The Strymon TimeLine delay pedal
  # TODO: Some delay types have different/additional configuration parameters
  # TODO: Such as dTape tape speed.
  # TODO: These are not done yet
  # There are two huge gotchas in the TimeLine:
  # When you change the delay machine (via MIDI CC 19), all other parameters are read from the pedal knobs.
  # Thus, this sequence does not have the expected behavior:
  #    Turn the mix knob all the way to the right (full wet)
  #    CC 14 64 channel 5 - to set the mix to half wet, half dry
  #    CC 19 2 channel 5 - to set the delay tye to Digital
  # Now, I would expect the delay type to be digital and the mix to half/half
  # However, it is actually delay type digital and the mix is all wet.
  # I have requested this be changed in future firmware updates, but no idea if it will happen.
  #
  # This means when using the TimeLine, when you change the delay type, you must then send all other parameters.
  #
  # The second huge gotcha is that when you change the delay type, you must wait 350ms before sending the other parameters
  # If you send them too quickly, they are ignored
  # This motivated me to add a 'followup' message (like a setup message but happens afterwards)
  # and a "Delay" message
