# FootSmart: an easier way to configure your Morningstar MC6Pro
## Overview
The Morningstar Editor is great software, but requires a lot of manual effort.
FootSmart is an alternative, configuring your MC6Pro from a YAML (or JSON) configuration file.
It may work with
other Morningstar products, but hasn't yet been tested with them.
- Human editable configuration file (YAML or JSON) can be stored in the cloud or in GitHub
- Named messages allow easy reuse and are more intuitive
- Named banks, easier to create jump to bank messages
- Named color palettes allow consistent use of colors in banks and presets
- **Easy to create presets that cycle through options**
- Logical structure, with messages defined in the device that consumes them


Instead of editing directly through the Morningstar editor, you edit the configuration file via any editor capable of handling YAML or JSON.
